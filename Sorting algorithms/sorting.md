# Sorting

## 1. Bubble Sort

- Know as Sinking sort.
- Compare the adjacent items, if it is not in order swap the places.

`Time Complexity` - `O(N^2)`

`Space Complexity` - `O(1)`

--- 

## 2. Selection Sort

- Repeatedly find the minimum element and move that to the sorted area.
- Used for small Arrays.
- This is space using sorting technique.

`Time Complexity` - `O(N^2)`

`Space Complexity` - `O(1)`

## 3. Insertion Sort

- Take the first item from the unsorted array. 
- Find the correct position in the sorted array.
- Repeart until unsorted array is empty.

`Time Complexity` - `O(N^2)`

`Space Complexity` - `O(1)`

## 4. Bucket sort

- Create bucket and distribute elements to the bucket.
- sort the buckets.
- Merge the buckets.

`Time Complexity` - `O(N^2)`

`Space Complexity` - `O(N)`
