- Know as Sinking sort.
- Compare the adjacent items, if it is not in order swap the places.

`Time Complexity` - `O(N^2)`

`Space Complexity` - `O(N)`

## 2. Selection Sort

- Repeatedly find the minimum element and move that to the sorted area.
- Used for small Arrays.
- This is space using sorting technique.
